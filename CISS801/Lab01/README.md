<h3> Lab 1: Structures, File I/O, and Data Validation </h3>
<p><strong> Objective: Practice defining complex structures, using file I/O, and validating user input. </strong></p>
<p> Create a Library system using a Book structure with the following requirements: <p> 
<ul> 
  <li> :white_check_mark:Define a Book struct with title, author, ISBN, and a yearPublished field. </li> 
    <li> :white_check_mark: Implement a Library class that stores a list of books and supports: </li>
    <li> :white_check_mark: Adding a book (with input validation: ISBN must be 13 digits, year must be between 1900 and 2024). </li>
    <li> :x: Searching for books by title, author, or ISBN. </li>
    <li> :white_check_mark: Sorting books by year, title, or author. </li>
    <li> :white_check_mark: Exporting all books to a text file. </li>
    <li> :white_check_mark: Importing books from a text file (with error handling for invalid formats). </li>
    <li> :white_check_mark: Use std::vector and std::ifstream/std::ofstream for file operations. </li>
    </li>
</ul>
