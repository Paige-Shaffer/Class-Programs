Decades later, in San Francisco, Martin, using the alias Martin Bishop, heads a penetration testing security specialist team that includes former CIA operative Donald Crease, technician and conspiracy theorist Darren "Mother" Roskow, hacking prodigy Carl Arbogast, and blind phone phreak Irwin "Whistler" Emery. After the team successfully infiltrates a bank to demonstrate their inadequate security, Martin is approached by two NSA agents. The men are aware of Martin's true identity and offer to clear his name and pay him $175,000 to recover a Russian-funded black box device codenamed "Setec Astronomy" from mathematician Gunter Janek. With assistance from his ex-girlfriend Liz, Martin and his team secure the box. However, they discover the device is a code breaker capable of infiltrating the most secure computer networks including financial and government systems. Martin realizes "Setec Astronomy" is an anagram of "too many secrets" and locks everyone down in their office until the device can be delivered to the NSA.
