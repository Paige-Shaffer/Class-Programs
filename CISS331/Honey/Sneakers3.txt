The following day, Martin hands the box to the agents, but Crease warns him to run after learning that Janek was murdered the night before. The team learns the box was actually funded by the NSA and the agents are imposters. Martin's friend Gregor, a spy in the Russian consulate, identifies one of them as a former NSA agent now working for a powerful crime organization. Men impersonating FBI agents arrive and kill Gregor, framing Martin by using his gun, before transporting Martin to an unknown location where it is revealed they are working for Cosmo. Because of his hacking talents, Cosmo had secured an early release from prison and was recruited by a crime organization to manage their illicit finances. Although the box could infiltrate their illegal networks, Cosmo wants it so he can finish what he and Martin started in 1969, destroying financial and ownership records to render the rich and poor as equals. He asks Martin to join him, but he refuses, considering Cosmo's plan extreme. Cosmo uses the box to access the FBI's systems and link Martin's current and former identities, making him a fugitive again. Martin is knocked unconscious and returned to the city.
